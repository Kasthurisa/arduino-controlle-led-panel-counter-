# arduino-controlle-led-panel-counter-
this project explains how to build arduino controlled led panel counter.  you have to use 16*32 led panel and arduino. here i just used atmega 328p microcontroler.

here is the pin connection for led pannel 

 nOE(D9) |1     2| A(D6)
 Gnd     |3     4| B(D7)
 Gnd     |5     6| C
 Gnd     |6     8| CLK(D13)
 Gnd     |7    10| SCLK(D8)
 Gnd     |11   12| R(D11)
 Gnd     |13   14| G
 Gnd     |15   16| D
